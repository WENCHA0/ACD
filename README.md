## Introduction
_~~To be updated~~_
***
## Installation
1. Install **AnyDesk** to have access to the remote computer which could use RSoft simulation software.
   * [Download AnyDesk here](https://anydesk.com/en "Link title")
   * Input Remote Address and Password
2. Set local repository path
   * A local repository must be created on the remote computer
   * The path must be set as **C: \ ACD**
3. The executable file could be found under
   * **C: \ ACD \ bin \ ACD.exe**
***
## Output
1. The auto-generated design (.ind file) is saved under
   * **C: \ ACD \ designs \ Test01.ind**
2. The results of Plane-wave expansion (PWE) simulation, the 4 frequencies(ω), are saved under
   * **C: \ ACD \ bin \ bstmp_eigs_TM.dat**
3. The results of Probablistic Markov Chain simulation are saved under
   * **C: \ ACD \ Tests \ PMC.csv**
4. The calculated **Kappa(κ)** and **α||** data are saved under
   * **C: \ ACD \data.csv**
